Ensuring that websites are designed and developed with accessibility in mind, such as using proper semantic markup, implementing keyboard navigation, and providing alternative text for images, is essential to create an inclusive online experience. I enjoy advocating for accessibility best practices and finding ways to make web projects more accessible and welcoming for all users.
